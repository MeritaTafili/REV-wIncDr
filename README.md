# REV-wIncDr
understanding constitutive models in representative elementary volume 

Session 1: includes an introduction to Incremental Driver (IncDr, written by Andrzej Niemunis), 
           coding a simple linear elastic umat and get used to IncDr commands
           a drained as well as an undrained triaxial test will be performed and plotted

Session 2: includes an introduction to tensor_tools.f (fortran based operations for tensors), 
           coding a simple hypo-elastic umat for sand and clay (void ratio and mean stress dependent)
           and get used to IncDr commands (additionally isotropic, oedometric, roscoe)
